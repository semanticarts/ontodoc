## To Do:

- Should have seperate hash/slash modes. Hash mode generates one document with anchors,
slash mode generates a bunch of documents in a directory structure. Can this be dertermined by the files?

- Add support for markdown in rdfs:comments (possibly with flag) and in site description.

- create fabfile deploy script

- probably gonna need a base URL at some point to make this workable.

- RDF SHOULD BE EMBEDDED IN DOCUMENT

- need to uniquify lists, filter out empty lists

- fancy link generator to check if object is in data before linking

- Fix separator styling

- Freeze requirements

- Convert to sass styles
